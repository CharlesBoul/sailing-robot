======= setup
- git pull
- check if there is a more recent launch file
- git push if needed
- set time
- run roscore
- run calibration script (compass + wind direction)
- run launch file
    check if data from wind direction and compass make sens
        - apply a heeling angle to the boat and see if the heading changes (topic 'heading_comp')
        - rotate the wind vane in various direction and check the topic 'wind_direction_apparent'
        - rotate the boat and keep the wind vane in a fixed position and check if the topic 'wind_direction_apparent' fluctuates (it shouldn't)
- check if sail servo is moving in relation to the wind direction
- monitor boat position with rviz
- put the boat in water and check if it actually floats, if not use a buoyancy aid or use autosub code instead of sailing boat one
