# Wind conditions:
# wind speed in m/s (1m/s = 1.9kts)
/simulation/wind/speed: 5

# wind direction relative to north
/simulation/wind/direction: 305


# Boat velocity
# velocity of the boat at 90Â° from the wind in with 1 m/s wind speed 
# for example in a 10kts wind, if the boat goes at 3kts, the coefficient is 0.3
/simulation/velocity/coefficient: 0.4

# Minimum velocity of the boat (in m/s)
/simulation/velocity/minimum: 0.5


/simulation/heading_init: 270.0


# Heading coefficient
# just a multiplicator coefficient for the heading control in case of need
/simulation/heading/coefficient: 1.0
