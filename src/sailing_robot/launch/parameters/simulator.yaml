# Wind conditions:

# wind speed in m/s (1m/s = 1.9kts)
/wind/speed: 5

# wind direction relative to north
/wind/direction: 15


# Boat velocity
# velocity of the boat at 90Â° from the wind in with 1 m/s wind speed 
# for example in a 10kts wind, if the boat goes at 3kts, the coefficient is 0.3
/velocity_coefficient: 0.3
