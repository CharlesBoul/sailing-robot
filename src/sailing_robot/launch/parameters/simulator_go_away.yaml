# Wind conditions:
# wind speed in m/s (1m/s = 1.9kts)
/simulation/wind/speed: 5

# wind direction relative to north

# Boat velocity
# velocity of the boat at 90Â° from the wind in with 1 m/s wind speed 
# for example in a 10kts wind, if the boat goes at 3kts, the coefficient is 0.3

# Heading coefficient
# just a multiplocator coefficient for the heading control in case of need
